# Clustering-Technique-for-Customer-Segmentation
In this project, we will look at customer using different category of merchant category and attempt to use their purchasing behaviour to identify what specific category we need to focused for new product. we try to identify various segments of customers within data with the help of clustering technique. 
Data:
There has three different files available for analysis.
Business account information data- it gives information of types of accounts customer wise and currency used in those accounts.
Customer information data- it gives demographic information of customers
Business transaction data- it gives merchant category transactions of each customer.
Process of clustering and segmentation
We have followed these steps for finding customer segmentation and clustering:
Cleaning of data
Data engineering-explore different categories customer wise
Merging data set
Visualize data
Scaling data
Select segmentation variables
Finding number of clusters- used k-means for clustering and elbow method for finding optimum number of clusters
Profile and interpret the results
For more better understanding, used r2 score and correlation between variables.
